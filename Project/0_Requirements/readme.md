## Discriptiom
A temperature sensor is a device, typically, a thermocouple or resistance temperature detector, that provides temperature measurement in a readable form through an electrical signal.A thermometer is the most basic form of a temperature meter that is used to measure the degree of hotness and coolness.Temperature meters are used in the geotechnical field to monitor concrete, structures, soil, water, bridges etc. for structural changes in them due to seasonal variations.A thermocouple (T/C) is made from two dissimilar metals that generate an electrical voltage in direct proportion with the change in temperature. An RTD (Resistance Temperature Detector) is a variable resistor that changes its electrical resistance in direct proportion with the change in the temperature in a precise, repeatable and nearly linear manner.
