## Abstract
Temperature is the number assigned to an object to indicate its warmth. The concept of temperature came about because people wanted to quantify and measure differences in warmth. When an object with a higher temperature comes in contact with a cooler object, a transfer of heat occurs until the two objects are the same temperature. When the heat transfer is complete, it can be said that that the two objects are in thermal equilibrium. Temperature can hence be defined as the quantity of warmth that is the same for two or more objects that are in thermal equilibrium. The temperature 0째C, 273.16 K (kelvin), is the point at which ice, water, and water vapor are all present and in thermal equilibrium.  During the invention of this thermometer some facts were not in place which lead to their disadvantages and with the aid of technology advancement digital thermometer came into existence. Digital thermometer brings together the likes of microcontroller to be interfaced with Lm35 temperature sensor all together working with an embedded C programming language. In advancement in technology, digital thermometer can be added to home automation utilizes, IOT service for medical records, industrial jobs and many more.
## Introduction
  - LM35 is a precession Integrated circuit Temperature sensor, whose output voltage varies, based  on the temperature around it.
  - It  is a  small and  cheap IC which can  be used to measure temperature anywhere between -55째C to 150째C.
  - It can easily be interfaced with any Microcontroller that has ADC function or any development platform like Arduino.
  - Power the IC by applying a regulated voltage like +5V (VS) to the input pin and connected the ground pin to the ground of the circuit.
  - If the temperature is 0째C, then the output voltage will also be 0V. There will be rise of 0.01V (10mV) for every degree  Celsius rise  in temperature.  The voltage can converted  into temperature  
## Components
