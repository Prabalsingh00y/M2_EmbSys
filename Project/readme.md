## Abstract
A heating system is a device that uses thermal energy to keep temperatures at a comfortable level in places such as cars,homes etc. It aids the system in raising the temperature of an enclosed room with the primary goal of assuring the occupants' comfort. The Seat Heating Control System regulates the temperature of an automobile seat. The button sensor is activated when a passenger or the driver of the car sits in the car seat (which acts as one switch). The user must next turn on the heater (which is known as the recirculation button and plays a vital function in the heat.The temperature sensors work by sensing the temperature emitted by the thermostat and/or the coolant, as well as monitoring and recording the temperature and sending the analogue value to the ATmega328 microcontroller. The temperature sensor's analogue input is fed into the microcontroller, which outputs a temperature reading via USART.
